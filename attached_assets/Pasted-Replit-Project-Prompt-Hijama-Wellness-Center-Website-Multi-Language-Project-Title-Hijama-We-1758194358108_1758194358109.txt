Replit Project Prompt: Hijama & Wellness Center Website (Multi-Language)
Project Title: Hijama & Wellness Center (Multi-Language)
Project Goal: Develop a professional, responsive, and user-friendly website for a traditional Hijama (Cupping Therapy) and wellness center, supporting Azerbaijani, Russian, and English languages. The website should effectively inform potential clients about services, benefits, and build trust in all three languages.
Technology Stack (Recommended for Replit):
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (for language switching, interactivity like carousels, accordions, form validation).
Optional Backend (for contact form submission if not using a third-party service): Node.js with Express (basic server for handling form submissions). For simplicity, initially, assume the contact form will either email directly (via mailto: or a client-side form submission service).
Detailed Replit Setup & File Structure (Multi-Language):
The core idea for multi-language is to either:
Duplicate HTML files for each language: e.g., index_az.html, index_ru.html, index_en.html. (Easier for small sites, but more redundant).
Use a single HTML file and dynamically load content with JavaScript: (More complex initially, but better for maintenance).
Given Replit's environment and for better maintainability, we'll opt for a hybrid approach: single HTML files for structure, and JavaScript to load content based on selected language. This means we'll store content in JSON files or directly in JavaScript objects.
Replit Environment: Choose a "Web Server" template (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS).

Content & Structure Requirements (Page by Page - HTML will contain placeholders, JS will fill them):
Each HTML file will have a basic structure and data-i18n attributes on elements that need to display translatable text. The translations.js file will hold all the actual text content for each language.
General Multi-Language Approach:
Language Selector: In the header, add a dropdown or buttons (AZ, RU, EN) to switch languages.
translations.js (or translations.json): This file will contain all translatable strings, structured like this:
code
JavaScript
// assets/js/translations.js
const translations = {
    "az": {
        "home_header_logo_alt": "Hicama Mərkəzi Loqosu",
        "home_nav_home": "Ana Səhifə",
        "home_nav_about": "Haqqımızda",
        "home_hero_headline": "Müasir Sağlamlıq Üçün Qədim Şəfa Təcrübəsi",
        // ... all text for Azerbaijani
    },
    "ru": {
        "home_header_logo_alt": "Логотип Центра Хиджамы",
        "home_nav_home": "Главная",
        "home_nav_about": "О нас",
        "home_hero_headline": "Опыт Древнего Исцеления для Современного Здоровья",
        // ... all text for Russian
    },
    "en": {
        "home_header_logo_alt": "Hijama Center Logo",
        "home_nav_home": "Home",
        "home_nav_about": "About Us",
        "home_hero_headline": "Experience Ancient Healing for Modern Wellness",
        // ... all text for English
    }
};
script.js: This will handle:
Loading the correct language from localStorage or default.
Updating all elements with data-i18n attributes based on the selected language.
Saving the user's language preference.
Example HTML structure for translatable elements:
code
Html
<!-- In index.html -->
<header>
    <img src="assets/images/logo.png" alt="Hijama Center Logo" data-i18n="home_header_logo_alt">
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="index.html" data-i18n="home_nav_home"></a></li>
            <li><a href="about.html" data-i18n="home_nav_about"></a></li>
            <!-- ... other nav items -->
        </ul>
    </nav>
    <div class="language-selector">
        <button data-lang="az">AZ</button>
        <button data-lang="ru">RU</button>
        <button data-lang="en">EN</button>
    </div>
</header>
<section class="hero">
    <h1 data-i18n="home_hero_headline"></h1>
    <p data-i18n="home_hero_subheadline"></p>
    <a href="#" class="btn" data-i18n="home_hero_cta"></a>
</section>

Design & Aesthetic Considerations (assets/css/style.css):
Color Palette: Use calming, natural colors (e.g., greens, blues, earthy tones, subtle golds).
Typography:
Use clean, legible sans-serif fonts that support Cyrillic, Latin, and Azerbaijani alphabets. Example: font-family: 'Open Sans', 'Roboto', Arial, sans-serif; for body text and font-family: 'Lora', 'Playfair Display', serif; for headings. (Link Google Fonts in index.html and other HTML files).
Imagery:
All images (assets/images/) should be high-quality, professional, and culturally sensitive.
Focus on wellness, natural healing, calm clinic environment, and professional practitioners.
Avoid graphic depictions of the cupping process unless very subtle and tasteful. Focus on the positive outcomes.
Layout:
Use CSS Flexbox and Grid for responsive and modern layouts.
Ensure consistent spacing, padding, and margins.
Mobile Responsiveness:
Implement @media queries in CSS to ensure the website looks and functions perfectly on all screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobile phones). This is critical.
Professionalism:
Clean, uncluttered design.
Easy navigation and clear calls to action.
Consistent branding (logo, colors, fonts).
Cultural Sensitivity:
The overall aesthetic should respect the traditional and cultural roots of Hijama. This can be conveyed through color choices, subtle patterns, and respectful imagery.
Interactive Elements (assets/js/script.js & assets/js/translations.js):
assets/js/translations.js: Contains all text content for az, ru, en languages, structured with unique keys.
assets/js/script.js:
Language Switching Logic:
Function to applyTranslations(lang) that iterates through all elements with data-i18n attributes and updates their textContent (or alt for images) using the translations object.
Event listeners for language selector buttons/dropdown to call applyTranslations().
Store/retrieve selected language in localStorage to remember user preference.
Default language: Azerbaijani (az) if no preference is found.
Navigation: Smooth scrolling for anchor links (optional).
Carousel: For testimonials section on index.html.
Accordion: For FAQ section on faq.html.
Form Validation: Basic client-side validation for the contact form (e.g., ensuring fields are not empty, email format is correct).
Mobile Menu Toggle: If implementing a hamburger menu for small screens.
Final Replit Instructions:
Create a new Replit project using the "HTML, CSS, JS" template.
Set up the file structure as described above, including the assets/js/translations.js file.
For each HTML file, create the structural elements and add data-i18n="your_translation_key" attributes to all text content that needs to be translated. Do not put actual text directly into these elements initially, let JavaScript handle it.
Populate assets/js/translations.js with all the required text for Azerbaijani, Russian, and English, using logical keys.
Implement the language switching logic in assets/js/script.js, along with other interactive elements.
Style the website using assets/css/style.css, adhering to the design considerations and ensuring font support for all three languages.
Ensure all internal links work correctly. When linking to other pages, the script.js will handle loading the correct language content once the new page loads.
Test for mobile responsiveness on various screen sizes.
Add a comprehensive README.md explaining the project, how to run it, and multi-language functionality.
